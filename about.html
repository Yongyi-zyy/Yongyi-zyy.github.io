        <h3>My Research - Female/ Feminist in Typography</h3>
        <br><h4>by Yongyi Zhu :)</h4>
        <br><br>
        <p>
        My research focuses on woman in typography. Since the most common fonts for people’s daily use are just a few such as Helvetica, the font design industry has been in a situation of multi-oligopoly. Along with the prejudices and stereotypes that the public had in the past about woman and women's design, made it difficult for female type designers to gain opportunities. In today's society, this problem has significantly improved but still exists and a lot of subtle relationships between typeface and female have emerged.. This Annotated Bibliography will focus on feminist and female in typography plus a small expansion of the research, including the history and crafting of typography, the historical bias against typography design based on gender, and feminist design.
