           Ridykeulous' work builds on the work of The Guerrilla Girls to create feminist art from a Lesbian perspective, utilising a more satirical, explicit and bold vocabulary to reconstruct The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist (The Guerrilla Girls 1988).
          This work demonstrates the diversity and resistance in feminist art, and for my research, she has handwritten notes to convey her
          vision of her attitudes and ideas.

            TITLE: Made in Patriarchy: Toward a Feminist Analysis of Women and Design.
            <br> AUTHOR: Cheryl Buckley
            <br> YEAR: 1986
            <br> SOURCE: https://doi.org/10.2307/1511480 
          </p>

            In this article Cheryl Buckley criticises the exclusion of women from design history, in other word, the fact that women's contributions are viewed and recorded as being based on a patriarchal society. She highlights how the design discipline has prioritised male-dominated fields such as industrial design, while calling women's work decorative art and often dismissing their contributions as 'feminine' or
'domesticated'.
Although this is an older article, but this article is still useful for feminist ypography research because it establishes a framework for understanding how gender bias affects the females in design.
Although this article does not focus specifically on typography, the discussion of the exclusion of women's design work and provides an important perspective for analysing the underrepresentation of
females in typography.
