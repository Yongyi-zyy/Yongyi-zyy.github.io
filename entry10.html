           Based on Jan Tschichold, Experimental Jetset made a more modern expansion of typography. De Theatercompagnie Driekoningenavond is a Shakespearean poster that Experimental Jetset designed for a Dutch theatre company in 2006. The theatre posters are very straightforward and show their characteristics as well as those of typography. They used only helvetica to design the poster, but it was a great way to show critical thinking and let the typeface speak for itself. It also proves that typography is not just about fonts, but how to use them to communicate ideas. They even managed to use strong visual typography design as a language for social reflection, unlike Jan Tschichold and Herbert Bayer.

            TITLE: Fetishising Language: Typography and Postfeminism in Late Capitalism.

            Ela takes a Marxist feminist perspective on current capitalism and the use of typography to commercialise feminism, and makes her argument real through three case studies. The argument is made through 3 case studies, and Dior's ‘WE SHOULD ALL BE FEMINISTS’ print T-shirt got a lot of hype. In terms of quality, it is a very ordinary T-shirt, so Dior bought the design and branding of the phrase. The font used for the phrase on the T-shirt is DIN 1451 Engschrift font, a condensed, geometric sans serif font, and more importantly, it's not gender related. But now this font is given a new definition, though it's commodifying feminism.
This article has been helpful in developing new perspectives to think about for my research, new ways of looking at the connection and even the pros and cons between feminism and fonts.
