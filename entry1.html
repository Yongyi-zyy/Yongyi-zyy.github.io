            This photograph by Ana Mendieta is a great example of how women are restricted and oppressed. The overall image looks very unnatural and uncomfortable, using the female body and the transparent glass to convey the uncomfortable treatment of women in society and the restrictions placed on women in a
patriarchal society.

            TITLE:A Feminist View on the Power of Typography: Making the Invisible Visible. <br> AUTHOR: Alyssa Duprey <br> YEAR:2015<br> SOURCE: https://www.academia.edu/12192722/A_Feminist_View_on_the_Power_of_Typography_Making_the_Invisible_Visible.

            This article contained so much of the information I needed to know, from the history and basic components of typography to the magazine's linking of women, type and sex. There is a section about how Beatrice Warde, known as the ‘First Lady of Typography’, studied type before the age of computers, but by the 1920s when women had the right to vote type design was still seen as an exclusively male-dominated profession. There is also a section that mentions words that people describe fonts in a gender-related way, such as the word feminine, which is used to describe a typeface as weak, feeble and fussy. It also defines decorative and finely detailed fonts as feminine taste, while darker and simpler fonts are considered masculine.
