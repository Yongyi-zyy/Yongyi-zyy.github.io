           Jan Tschichold was one of the most important typographers of modern typography and the creator of The New Typography. His work was completely different from the last two designers and he emphasised simplicity, logic, functionality with a strong grid system.
He designed the Graphische Berufsschule München (Graphic Professional School Munich) letterhead in 1927, which is a clear and simple composition that reflects his function over decoration typographic characteristics and style.

            TITLE: WOMEN in PRINT

            This article tells the story of women's significant contributions to the history of publication and printing design, production, distribution and consumption across history from Bologna in the 13th century to the present day in the 20th century. Proving that book publishing and graphic design do not have to be male-dominated. The importance and rise of women within the printing industry is demonstrated through involvement with the reveal women's agency, strong data support and involvement in political movements. I also researched women in the print industry as typography is very closely linked to book publishing and printing. I found that women in publishing emerged earlier and developed stronger than female in typography.
