           Barbara Kruger is a very famous feminist artist. Her 1992 cover for Ms. Magazine shows her signature bold white lettering on a red background. In this piece of artwork it is clear that she is using her famous style to once again make society reflect on the power of women. What does rage stand for in the picture, this time not irrational and threatening but productive and empowerment.

            TITLE: Print media design through feminism approaches / Pibool Waijittragum and Palang Wongtanasuporn
            <br> AUTHOR: Pibool Waijittragum
            <br> YEAR: 2019

            The aim of this research is to find content and layout designs suitable for print media based on feminist theory. The experiment they propose is to conduct a questionnaire that includes different styles, content, layout and typography options. The result of the experiment was that women preferred text arrangement with grid system arrangement as well as warm colours and vivid and bright tone of layout and fonts. The study also used an example of Thai writing, where the horizontal arrangement of text conveys a sense of unity, warmth and friendliness. The new idea that this gave me to open up in my research is that the viewing experience can vary from text to text. And that female viewers are an important part of female in typography.
