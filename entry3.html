           In this work Mary Beth Edelson makes very direct use of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper to show the exclusivity of male power in Western society and art history. She randomly placed famous female artists of the time at the head of the figure to demonstrate equality and solidarity within the feminist community.
It is undeniable that in 1972 it was rare for feminist art to be so visually appealing, and to be able to show women's abilities and
artistic talent so directly.

            TITLE: Non-existent design: women and the creation of type
            <br> AUTHOR: Sibylle Hagmann
            <br> YEAR: 2005
            <br> SOURCE: https://doi.org/10.1177/1470357205053401

            This article provides a strong data base to substantiate my ideas and observations about the current status of typography. Sibylle shares the experience of participating in a Typography exhibition in which she was the only female designer amongst a large number of other designers. She first blames gender inequality for this phenomenon, and then begins a process of self-questioning that is driven by stereotypes. Instead of doubting herself, she collected the type designs date of the major type foundries and the correlation between the gender of the designers. Her data and bar charts show that from 2003 to 2004, the number of typefaces produced by female designers has never exceeded 17% of the typefaces published by the foundry, which is a very low rate, and is even decreasing. She also points out that in the 19th century women's art was centred on small, decorative objects such as cafting, weaving, textile painting, and pottery, and women were hardly ever involved in widely used designs such as typography, which created stereotypes about women's design.
