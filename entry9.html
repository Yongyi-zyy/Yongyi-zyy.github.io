           Ryuichi Yamashiro is a 20th century Japanese post-war artist, and this work is an experimental piece of typography depicting postwar nature. Throughout the piece, the word '森林' which means forest is repeated to show the reconstruction of post-war Japan and its natural environment. This shows that typography design can be used to convey history and stories in a simple form or even just repetition of fonts.

          <h3>Typography</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Typography is an art and technique by using, arranging and even printing type(s) to make a piece of art. This form will be much more than just typing a typeface or font, typography is a "book's visual focus, rather than any separate pictorial elements" (Jury 2018: 21).
And in modern era, typography has gone far beyond maintaining readability, with artists experimenting more with the diversity and possibilities of typefaces.

            TITLE: Reinventing Print: <br>Technology and Craft in Typograph
            <br> AUTHOR: David Jury
            <br> YEAR: 2018

            In this book Jury talks about the historical development of graphic design, typography design and printing technology and its unique value. The article doesn't specifically mention women but mentions very strongly the history in typography and how the digital age has affected it. I focused on the typography difficulties and tips in the article, which included keeping the text readable, having knowledge of materials and processes, paying attention to detail and considering the reader's perceptions. One of the difficulties Jury mentions is designing within commercial constraints, which can be difficult for female type designers as women have more constraints in society nowadays such as glass ceilings, but for the rest of the craftsmanship requirements women are perfectly capable of fulfilling or even doing better.
