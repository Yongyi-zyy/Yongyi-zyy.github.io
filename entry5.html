           The Guerrilla Girls are one of the most iconic feminist art groups now.
All of their works criticise the inequality of women in the art world.
One of their most famous works is a critique of the large number of nude women in museums, 'Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?' (Guerrilla Girls 1989) They use ironic language and strong visuals to give the audience a strong reflective experience.
Within my research topic, the fonts they utilise have been bold Helvetica or Futura, very common leading to neutral fonts that can be
very effective in drawing the viewer's eye.

          <h3>Journal Article</h3>
        <p>
            TITLE: Women Only: Design Events Restricted to Female Designers during the 1990s 
            <br> AUTHOR: Javier Gimeno Mart√≠nez
            <br> YEAR: 2007
            <br> SOURCE: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25224103 
          </p>
          <p>
            In this article, Martinez suggests that female-specific events and design outputs are effective in increasing visibility and creating supportive networks, but also have the potential to reinforce stereotypes. The gender-specific nature of the events and designs limits the effectiveness of some of the promotions and can be interpreted as stereotype-compliant behaviour. For example, second wave feminist has the impression of man-hating, stridency, joylessness and bad clothes. I remain neutral on this article, although the possibility of reinforcing stereotypes as he mentions is there. But I think that by challenging traditional norms we are changing for the better and communicating our own attitudes.
